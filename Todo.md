I have a webpage project using Django, python, html,javascript, ajax and bootstrap. I have a html page that displays a set of card. Each card contains the information
about a map boundary. I will give you the javascript code to create the cards.
I want you to add a button to each of the cards that provides a link to a new
html page. Each card should have it's own unique html page. If the user navigates
to the page of a boundary the information for that boundary should be displayed.
The url should contain the id of the boundary. Write me the updated html where each card has a button with a hyperlink to it's own page. Create the Django view to make this work and any updates to the html.
Here is the javascript function that creates the boundary cards:
